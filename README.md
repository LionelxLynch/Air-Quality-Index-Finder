## Description

The Air Quality Index (AQI) Application is a web-based tool that utilizes the OpenWeather API to retrieve the current air quality index for a specific latitude and longitude entered by the user. It then displays the location on a map, providing valuable information about the air quality in real-time.

This application is developed using a combination of technologies. The backend is built with Spring Boot and Java, offering a robust and efficient foundation for handling data and business logic. On the frontend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

The AQI Application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run in different environments.
