# Air Quality Finder

This application uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve the current air quality index (AQI) for a specific latitude and longitude entered by the user. It also displays the location on a map.

## Technologies
- Programming languages: Java
- Web development frameworks: Spring Boot
- Front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet
- API: OpenWeather API
- Server technologies: Tomcat server
- Version control: GitHub
- Integrated development environment (IDE): IntelliJ




## Usage

To use this application, you will need to replace the `apiKey` value in the `Service` class with an active API key, as the one included in the project is disabled. Once you have done this, you can run the main file to start the Tomcat server, which will be routed to `localhost:8080`. You can then enter the latitude and longitude of the location you are interested in to retrieve the current AQI reading.

## Dependencies

This application is built using Spring Boot, and all necessary dependencies are included in the `pom.xml` file.
